# Rhythm-Game-Lib
Libraries to make a creating a rhythm game in Godot easier.

  To use: 
          put Conductor.tcsn at the top node of your game, attach ConductorScript to it if it isn't already.
          change Conductor's music to what you want, I would recommend .opus
          input the bpm into the bpm variable
          put the offset that you want (because metadata in the .opus file) into the offset variable
          wait for updates or read my comments and try to figure out what to do.
